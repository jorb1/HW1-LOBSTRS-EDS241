#### DATA SOURCE:

Reed D. 2019. SBC LTER: Reef: Abundance, size and fishing effort for California Spiny Lobster (Panulirus interruptus), ongoing since 2012. Environmental Data Initiative. <https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/a593a675d644fdefb736750b291579a0>. Dataset accessed 11/17/2019.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Introduction**

You're about to dive into some deep data collected from five reef sites in Santa Barbara County, all about the abundance of California spiny lobsters! ðŸ¦ž Data was gathered by divers annually from 2012 to 2018 across Naples, Mohawk, Isla Vista, Carpinteria, and Arroyo Quemado reefs.

Why lobsters? Well, this sample provides an opportunity to evaluate the impact of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) established on January 1, 2012 (Reed, 2019). Of these five reefs, Naples, and Isla Vista are MPAs, while the other three are not protected (non-MPAs). Comparing lobster health between these protected and non-protected areas gives us the chance to study how commercial and recreational fishing might impact these ecosystems.

We will consider the MPA sites the `treatment` group and use regression methods to explore whether protecting these reefs really makes a difference compared to non-MPA sites (our control group). In this assignment, weâ€™ll think deeply about which causal inference assumptions hold up under the research design and identify where they fall short.

Letâ€™s break it down step by step and see what the data reveals! ðŸ“Š

![](figures/map-5reefs.png)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Anticipating potential sources of selection bias

**a.** Do the control sites (Arroyo Quemado, Carpenteria, and Mohawk) provide a strong counterfactual for our treatment sites (Naples, Isla Vista)? Write a paragraph making a case for why this comparison is centris paribus or whether selection bias is likely (be specific!).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Read & wrangle data

**a.** Read in the raw data. Name the data.frame (`df`) `rawdata`

**b.** Use the function `clean_names()` from the `janitor` package

```{r}
# HINT: check for coding of missing values (`na = "-99999"`)
# Read in CSV, defining NAs and cleaning names
rawdata <- read_csv(here("data", "spiny_abundance_sb_18.csv"), na = "-99999") |>
    clean_names()

# Virew the dataframe to ensure it worked
head(rawdata)


```

**c.** Create a new `df` named `tidyata`. Using the variable `site` (reef location) create a new variable `reef` as a `factor` and add the following labels in the order listed (i.e., re-order the `levels`):

```         
"Arroyo Quemado", "Carpenteria", "Mohawk", "Isla Vista",  "Naples"
```

```{r}

tidydata <- rawdata |>
    mutate(reef = factor(site, order = TRUE,
                         levels = c("AQUE",
                                    "CARP",
                                    "MOHK",
                                    "IVEE",
                                    "NAPL"),
                         labels = c("Arroyo Quemado",
                                    "Carpinteria",
                                    "Mohawk",
                                    "Isla Vista",
                                    "Naples")))
    
```

Create new `df` named `spiny_counts`

**d.** Create a new variable `counts` to allow for an analysis of lobster counts where the unit-level of observation is the total number of observed lobsters per `site`, `year` and `transect`.

-   Create a variable `mean_size` from the variable `size_mm`
-   NOTE: The variable `counts` should have values which are integers (whole numbers).
-   Make sure to account for missing cases (`na`)!

**e.** Create a new variable `mpa` with levels `MPA` and `non_MPA`. For our regression analysis create a numerical variable `treat` where MPA sites are coded `1` and non_MPA sites are coded `0`

```{r}
#HINT(d): Use `group_by()` & `summarize()` to provide the total number of lobsters observed at each site-year-transect row-observation. 

#HINT(e): Use `case_when()` to create the 3 new variable columns

spiny_counts <- tidydata |>
    group_by(site, year, transect) |>
    summarize(count = sum(count, na.rm = TRUE),
              mean_size = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
    mutate(mpa = case_when(site %in% c("IVEE", "NAPL") ~ "MPA",
                           site %in% c("CARP", "MOHK", "AQUE") ~ "non_MPA")) |>
    mutate(treat = case_when(mpa == "MPA" ~ 1,
                             mpa == "non_MPA" ~ 0)) |>
    ungroup()

# Verify the wrangling worked
unique(spiny_counts$mpa)
unique(spiny_counts$treat)

```

> NOTE: This step is crucial to the analysis. Check with a friend or come to TA/instructor office hours to make sure the counts are coded correctly!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Explore & visualize data

**a.** Take a look at the data! Get familiar with the data in each `df` format (`tidydata`, `spiny_counts`)

**b.** We will focus on the variables `count`, `year`, `site`, and `treat`(`mpa`) to model lobster abundance. Create the following 4 plots using a different method each time from the 6 options provided. Add a layer (`geom`) to each of the plots including informative descriptive statistics (you choose; e.g., mean, median, SD, quartiles, range). Make sure each plot dimension is clearly labeled (e.g., axes, groups).

-   [Density plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/density-plot-group-ggplot2)
-   [Ridge plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/ggridges/)
-   [Jitter plot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_jitter.html)
-   [Violin plot](https://r-charts.com/distribution/violin-plot-group-ggplot2)
-   [Histogram](https://r-charts.com/distribution/histogram-density-ggplot2/)
-   [Beeswarm](https://r-charts.com/distribution/beeswarm/)

Create plots displaying the distribution of lobster **counts**:

1)  grouped by reef site\
2)  grouped by MPA status
3)  grouped by year

Create a plot of lobster **size** :

4)  You choose the grouping variable(s)!

```{r}
# Plot 1: A ridge plot grouped by reef site

spiny_counts |>
ggplot(aes(x = count, y = site)) + 
    geom_density_ridges(quantile_lines = TRUE,
                        quantiles = 2,
                        alpha = .5,
                        fill = "seagreen") +
    xlab("Spiny Lobster Count") +
    ylab("Reef Site") +
    labs(title = "Distribution of Spiny Lobster Counts by Site") +
    theme_light()
    
```

```{r}
# Plot #2: a beeswarm plot grouped by year
custom_colors <- c("seagreen", "yellow3")

beeswarm(spiny_counts$count ~ spiny_counts$year,
         pch = 19,
         pwcol = custom_colors[factor(spiny_counts$mpa)],
         xlab = "Year",
         ylab = "Lobster Count",
         main = "Lobster Count by Year, colored by MPA Type")

legend("topright", legend = c("MPA", "non-MPA"),
           col = custom_colors, pch = 19)

```

```{r}
# Plot #3: Violin plot of MPA status
spiny_counts |>
    ggplot(aes(x=count, y=mpa)) +
    geom_violin(color = "seagreen", fill = "seagreen", alpha = 0.5) +
    xlab("Lobster Count") +
    ylab("MPA Status") +
    labs(title = "Count of Spiny Lobster grouped by MPA status") +
    theme_light()
```

```{r}
# Plot #4: Stacked Bar Plot of lobster size
spiny_counts |>
    ggplot(aes(x=mean_size, fill = mpa)) +
    geom_histogram(color = "black") +
    xlab("Mean Size of Spiny Lobster (mm)") +
    ylab("Spiny Lobster Count") +
    labs(title = "Size Distribution of Spiny Lobsters, by MPA Status") +
    theme_light()
```

**c.** Compare means of the outcome by treatment group. Using the `tbl_summary()` function from the package [`gt_summary`](https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/articles/tbl_summary.html)

```{r}
# USE: gt_summary::tbl_summary()
# Compare the means of the counts by treatment group
spiny_counts |> 
    dplyr::select(treat, count) |>
    tbl_summary(
        by = treat,
        statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})")) |> 
    modify_header(label ~ "**Variable**") |>
    modify_spanning_header(c("stat_1", "stat_2") ~ "**Treatment**") 
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4: OLS regression- building intuition

**a.** Start with a simple OLS estimator of lobster counts regressed on treatment. Use the function `summ()` from the [`jtools`](https://jtools.jacob-long.com/) package to print the OLS output

**b.** Interpret the intercept & predictor coefficients *in your own words*. Use full sentences and write your interpretation of the regression results to be as clear as possible to a non-academic audience.

```{r}
# NOTE: We will not evaluate/interpret model fit in this assignment (e.g., R-square)

m1_ols <- lm(count ~ treat, spiny_counts)

summ(m1_ols, model.fit = FALSE) 

```
**The intercept coefficient represents the number of lobster counts with the treatment group is 0. Since our treatment group is the not-MPA group, this analysis tells us that there is 22.73 lobsters on average in not MPAs, so there are 5.36 more lobsters on average in the MPA group. The p-value is above the .05 threshold for statistical significance.**

**c.** Check the model assumptions using the `check_model` function from the `performance` package

**d.** Explain the results of the 4 diagnostic plots. Why are we getting this result?

```{r}
check_model(m1_ols,  check = "qq" )
```

```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "normality")
```

```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "homogeneity")
```

```{r}
check_model(m1_ols, check = "pp_check")
```
**These four plots show that the data are not normally distributed. The data seems to be right skewed. So, we assume that there is a violation in the assumptions of OLS. The lm() is probably not the best model to use on this data as a result.**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5: Fitting GLMs

**a.** Estimate a Poisson regression model using the `glm()` function

```{r}
#HINT1: Incidence Ratio Rate (IRR): Exponentiation of beta returns coefficient which is interpreted as the 'percent change' for a one unit increase in the predictor 

#HINT2: For the second glm() argument `family` use the following specification option `family = poisson(link = "log")`

# Run a Poissoin model
m2_pois <- glm(count ~ treat,
               family = poisson(link = "log"),
               data = spiny_counts)

# Print the output
summ(m2_pois, model.fit=FALSE)

# Code the IRR, Incidence Ratio Rate
exp(m2_pois$coefficients[2]) -1

```

**b.** Interpret the predictor coefficient in your own words. Use full sentences and write your interpretation of the results to be as clear as possible to a non-academic audience.

**By calculating the IRR, we can see that there is a 23.5% increase in lobster counts in MPA group, vs the non-MPA group.**

**c.** Explain the statistical concept of dispersion and overdispersion in the context of this model.

**One of the assumptions of Poisson regression is that variance is proportional to the mean. So, if the data is super dispersed, than the variance is greater than the mean.**

**d.** Compare results with previous model, explain change in the significance of the treatment effect

**In the lm() model, there was 5.36 more lobsters on average within MPAs compared to outside of them. In the Poisson model, there is slightly less than that, so the relationship between lobster counts inside vs outside MPAs is slightly less dramatic.**

**e.** Check the model assumptions. Explain results.

**After running the analysis below, I can see that Poisson is also likely not a good fit for this data. When measuring uniformity of residuals, the dots do not fall along the line. The homogenity of variance looks better, as the reference line is flat and horizontal. However, in the chart showing misspecified dispersion and zero-inflation, the green line does not follow the line of the predicted mean. So, it seems like I am violating some of the assumptions of the Poisson model.** 

**f.** Conduct tests for over-dispersion & zero-inflation. Explain results.

**I ran these tests below. The tests show that the model is predicint less zeros than are actually present in the data. So, there may be zero inflation. The dispersion test shows that the variance is significantly larger than the mean, which means we are violating one of the assumptions, and the model is not the best fit.**

```{r}
check_model(m2_pois)
```

```{r}
check_overdispersion(m2_pois)
```

```{r}
check_zeroinflation(m2_pois)
```

**g.** Fit a negative binomial model using the function glm.nb() from the package `MASS` and check model diagnostics

**I ran this in the provided code chunk below**

**h.** In 1-2 sentences explain rationale for fitting this GLM model.

**This is a negative binomial regression model. It is a model that allows us to relax the assumption that the variance is equal to the mean. Since the variance is not equal to the mean in our data, this model may be a better choice for this analysis**

**i.** Interpret the treatment estimate result in your own words. Compare with results from the previous model.

**This model shows that there is a 23% increase in lobsters within MPAs, compared to outside. This is extremely similar to our previous model. Wheb we do our checks below, however, we can see that this model does a much better job with over dispersion and zero inflation.**

```{r}

# NOTE: The `glm.nb()` function does not require a `family` argument
# Run the model
m3_nb <- glm.nb(count ~ treat, spiny_counts)

# Print results
summ(m3_nb, model.fit = FALSE)

# Calculate IRR
exp(m2_pois$coefficients[2]) -1

```

```{r}
check_overdispersion(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_zeroinflation(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_predictions(m3_nb)
```

```{r}
check_model(m3_nb)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 6: Compare models

**a.** Use the `export_summ()` function from the `jtools` package to look at the three regression models you fit side-by-side.

**c.** Write a short paragraph comparing the results. Is the treatment effect `robust` or stable across the model specifications.

```{r}

export_summs(m1_ols, m2_pois, m3_nb,
             model.names = c("OLS","Poisson", "NB"),
             statistics = "none")

```
**It seems to me that in all three models, there is a "robust" treatment effect between the two groups. Or, the relationship between MPAs and non-MPAs is stable across the model specifications.**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 7: Building intuition - fixed effects

**a.** Create new `df` with the `year` variable converted to a factor

**b.** Run the following OLS model using `lm()`

-   Use the following specification for the outcome `log(counts+1)`
-   Estimate fixed effects for `year`
-   Include an interaction term between variables `treat` and `year`

**c.** Take a look at the regression output. Each coefficient provides a comparison or the difference in means for a specific sub-group in the data. Informally, describe the what the model has estimated at a conceptual level (NOTE: you do not have to interpret coefficients individually)

**d.** Explain why the main effect for treatment is negative? \*Does this result make sense?

```{r}

ff_counts <- spiny_counts %>% 
    mutate(year=as_factor(year))
    
m5_fixedeffs <- lm(
    log(counts+1) ~ treat*year,
    data = ff_counts)

summ(m5_fixedeffs, model.fit = FALSE)
```

**e.** Look at the model predictions: Use the `interact_plot()` function from package `interactions` to plot mean predictions by year and treatment status.

**f.** Re-evaluate your responses (c) and (b) above.

```{r}

# Hint 1: Group counts by `year` and `mpa` and calculate the `mean_count`
# Hint 2: Convert variable `year` to a factor

interact_plot(m5_fixedeffs, pred = year, modx = treat,
              outcome.scale = "response")

```

**g.** Using `ggplot()` create a plot in same style as the previous `interaction plot`, but displaying the original scale of the outcome variable (lobster counts). This type of plot is commonly used to show how the treatment effect changes across discrete time points (i.e., panel data).

The plot should have... - `year` on the x-axis - `counts` on the y-axis - `mpa` as the grouping variable

```{r}
# Hint 1: Group counts by `year` and `mpa` and calculate the `mean_count`
# Hint 2: Convert variable `year` to a factor

plot_counts <- 

# plot_counts %>% ggplot() ...
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 8: Reconsider causal identification assumptions

a.  Discuss whether you think `spillover effects` are likely in this research context (see Glossary of terms; <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RIudsVcYhWGpqC-Uftk9UTz3PIq6stVyEpT44EPNgpE/edit?usp=sharing>)

b.  Explain why spillover is an issue for the identification of causal effects

c.  How does spillover relate to impact in this research setting?

d.  Discuss the following causal inference assumptions in the context of the MPA treatment effect estimator. Evaluate if each of the assumption are reasonable:

    1)  SUTVA: Stable Unit Treatment Value assumption
    2)  Excludability assumption

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# EXTRA CREDIT

> Use the recent lobster abundance data with observations collected up until 2024 (`lobster_sbchannel_24.csv`) to run an analysis evaluating the effect of MPA status on lobster counts using the same focal variables.

a.  Create a new script for the analysis on the updated data
b.  Run at least 3 regression models & assess model diagnostics
